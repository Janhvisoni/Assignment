        <h1>Java Script</h1>
        <p>JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development. It was originally developed by
            Netscape as a means to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites. While JavaScript is influenced by
            Java, the syntax is more similar to C and is based on ECMAScript, a scripting language developed by Sun
            Microsystems.</p>

            <p>JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, which means the source code is processed by the client's web
            browser rather than on the web server. This means JavaScript functions can run after a webpage has loaded
            without communicating with the server. For example, a JavaScript function may check a web form before it is
            submitted to make sure all the required fields have been filled out. The JavaScript code can produce an
            error message before any information is actually transmitted to the server.</p>

        <p>Like server-side scripting languages, such as PHP and ASP, JavaScript code can be inserted anywhere within
            the HTML of a webpage. However, only the output of server-side code is displayed in the HTML, while
            JavaScript code remains fully visible in the source of the webpage. It can also be referenced in a separate
            .JS file, which may also be viewed in a browser.</p>

        <p>Below is an example of a basic JavaScript function that adds two numbers. The function is called with the
            parameters 7 and 11. If the code below were included in the HTML of a webpage, it would display the text
            "18" in an alert box.</p>

            <"script"><br>
                function sum(a, b) {<br>
                    return a + b;<br>
                }<br>
                var total = sum(7, 11);<br>
                alert(total);<br>
            <"/script"><br>

            <p>JavaScript functions can be called within
            <"script"> tags or when specific events take place.Examples include onClick, onMouseDown, onMouseUp, onKeyDown, onKeyUp, onFocus,
            onBlur, onSubmit, and many others.While standard JavaScript is still used for performing basic client -
            side functions, many web developers now prefer to use JavaScript libraries like jQuery to add more
            advanced dynamic elements to websites.</p >
