    <h1>Windows Programming</h1>
    <p>        
        • C++ as a language can be seen from two perspective:<br>
        --- Native IS0/ANSI C++ Windows application development.<br>
        --- Development of C++/CLI windows applications using windows Forms.<br>
        • Microsoft .Net Framework:<br>
        --- The .Net framework is a central-concept in visual C++ as well as other .Net development
        products from Microsoft. The .Net framework consists of two elements.<br>
        --- The Common Language Runtime(CLR), in which the application execute, and<br>
        --- a set of libraries called the .Net framework class libraries.<br>
        --- .Net framework class libraries provides the functional support to the code, when it is
        executing the CLR, regardless of the programming language used.<br>
        --- So, .Net programs written in C++ or any other language that support the .Net framework
        all use the same .Net libraries<br>
        Basically there are two fundamental different kinds of C++ applications, we can develop
        with visual C++:<br>
        --- Application that natively execute on our computer. These applications are referred to as
        native C++ programs. We write native C++ program in the version of C++ that is defined
        by ISO/ANSI language standard.<br>
        --- We can also write applications to run under the control of the CLR in an extended
        version of C++, called C++/CLI. These Programs are referred to as CLR program or
        C++/CLI Program.<br>
        • The .Net framework is not strictly part of visual C++, but rather a component of the
        windows operating system that makes it easier to build Software(s/w) application.
        • Advantage of .Net Framework:<br>
        --- Code Reliability(Fault Tolerance), Security, and Ability to integrate C++ code with other
        languages that targets the .Net framework<br>
        Definition: {Common Language Runtime, CLR}<br>
        The CLR is a standardized-environment for execution of program written in a wide-range of
        high-level languages including visual C++.<br>
        • Important: The specification of the CLR is standardized by European Computer
        Manufacturer (ECMA) standard for the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI), and CLR is an
        implementation of that standard for Microsoft Windows.<br>
        --- That is why C++ for CLR is referred to as C++/CLI, as it is the implementation of
        specification of CLI by CLR.<br>
        • Definition: {Common Language Infrastructure, CLI}<br>
        The CLI is a specification for a Virtual Machine environment that enables applications
        written in diverse high-level programming language to be executed in different system
        environment, without changing or recompiling the original source code.<br>
        The CLI specifies a standard intermediate language for the virtual machine to which the
        high-level language code is compiled. With .Net framework, this intermediate language is
        called Microsoft Intermediate Language(MSIL). The code in the intermediate language is
        ultimately mapped to machine code by a Just-In-Time(JIT) compiler, when we execute the
        program.<br>
        --- Code in the CLI intermediate language can be executed within any other environment
        that has a CLI implementation.<br>
        • The CLI also defines a common set of data types called the Common Type System(CTS), that
        should be used for program written in any programming language targeting a CLI
        implementation.<br>
        --- The CTS specifies how data types are used within the CLR and includes a set of
        predefined types. We can Create our own datatypes, but that must be consistent with
        CTS.</p>
